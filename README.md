Mini Data Projects

In this repo I'm going to put some mini projects I've worked on that showcase basic analytics skills (cleaning, extraction, tabular presentation).

The Fraugster assignment is actually a takehome I got during an interview process.

As I continue to get more familiar with GitHub and make more projects, I'll upload them.
